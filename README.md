# Vertex Overlap

A Blender N-panel add-on that alerts you to overlapping vertices in real-time. Found under the `Edit` N-panel.

## Features

-  Alerts you to new overlapping vertices in real-time. Disabled by default, but enabled with a simple checkbox. Have you ever started, then canceled an extrusion? If you don't remember to immediately undo your last action, you will create overlapping vertices that aren't easy to spot until you start noticing weird rendering issues or you experience odd issues while editing your mesh.
- You to set a custom `Overlap Threshold` distance. If you only want to be alerted about overlapping vertices of a certain distance, you can specify a custom distance. The default is 0.0001m.
- If real-time checking is disabled, you can manually check for overlapping vertices by clicking the `Check Overlaps` button at anytime while in Edit mode.
- Provides a convenient `Merge Vertices` button that will merge overlapping vertices by the configured `Overlap Threshold` distance. This is equivalent to `Selecting All` and then `Merging by Distance`. Now in a convenient single click.
- If you select multiple objects and tab to `Edit` mode, the `Overlapping Vertices` count will reflect the number of overlapping vertices in both mesh objects combined. If you have two objects, each with 2 overlapping vertices, and select both then tab to Edit mode, `Vertex Overlap` will show `4` total overlapping vertices.

## Supported Blender Versions

### Changelog

#### 12/17/24 (v1.0.8)
- Fixed overlap_threshold bug

#### 12/17/24 (v1.0.7)
- Removed 3D View tag
- Stopped registering stray properties on Scene ID

#### 12/13/24 (v1.0.6)
- Initial release to Blender Extensions platform.
- Added a checkbox to enable/disable real-time checking of overlapping vertices. Now you can leave real-time checking disabled, but still use the `Check Overlaps` button to manually check for overlapping vertices. Or you can enable real-time checking to be immediately alerted to overlapping vertices.
- Moved Vertex Overlap to the `Edit` N-Panel instead of its own dedicated N-Panel to reduce clutter.
- You can now select multiple objects, tab to edit mode, and Vertex Overlap will give you a count of all overlapping vertices for all objects.
- Added polling to make sure the active object is of type `MESH`.
- Removed supported platforms since the extension can be used by Windows, Linux, and Mac by default.
- Changed default merge distance to 0.0001m.
